\begin{abstract}
Evolutionary algorithms often incorporate ecological concepts to help maintain diverse populations and drive continued innovation. However, while there is strong evidence for the value of ecological dynamics, the precise mechanisms behind these results are not always clear. These gaps in our understanding make it challenging to predict which approaches will be most appropriate for a given problem. Ecologists have addressed similar questions for many decades, but the resulting body of theory has yet to be fully translated into an evolutionary context. This paper lays the groundwork for such a translation by adapting ecological theory to three different selection mechanisms in evolutionary computation: fitness sharing, lexicase selection, and Eco-EA. First, we use ecological ideas to establish a framework that clarifies where these selection schemes are alike and where they differ. We then build upon this framework by using metrics from ecology to gather empirical data about the underlying differences in the population dynamics that these approaches produce. Specifically, we measure phylogenetic relationships within the population to explore long-term stable coexistence. These results can inform parameter selection, choice of selection scheme, and the development of new selection schemes.
